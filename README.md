# CS-Portfolio

Description: This portfolio project implements the game Connect 4.

Beginning Instructions: Once all the files have been downloaded, navigate to the folder containing them in Ubuntu. Once there, enter the command "make" into the command line to compile all of the necessary files. After the files have finished compiling, enter the command "c4" to begin the game.

Menu Navigation: The game menu will display two options to you and prompt for input. To select a menu option, simply enter one of the two options listed on the menu into the command line. The game will accept menu options that are typed as displayed or in all lowercase. Inproper input will prompt a message telling you that what you entered will not work and you will be asked again to enter a choice until you provide valid input.

Custom Board Sizes: Monitors vary in size, but for a 13.5" by 7.5" monitor the maximum width that the board will display well on is 41. If you choose a width that is wider than can be printed on your screen, the game still functions properly but the board display will look off as it will be printing more information onto your screen in each line than will fit. In addition, the game allows for infinitely large board sizes, but the column numbering begins to drift off place after the 10,000th column. So, in case you were planning on playing Connect 4 on a board more than 9,999 columns wide, you may have some trouble determining the correct column to drop your piece into. 

Ending the Game: After a winner has been decided or a tie has been reached in a round, the game will ask if you want to rematch. Selecting your answer works the same way as selecting a menu option. If you choose to rematch, the game will bring you to the board size selection menu of the game mode you initially chose, so that you may alter the board size for the next round if you wish.
